Aoinagi Karate traces its roots to the traditional Okinawa Shito-ryu
style of karate in Japan. Shito-ryu was founded by Kenwa Mabuni in
1931 and is one of four major styles of karate in Japan. Aoinagi means
the “Green Willow Tree” and was formed by Sensei Raymond Castilonia in
Redlands, California, USA. Sensei Castilonia choose Aoinagi as the
name of his karate school, because he wanted his organization to
embody the uncanny ability of the Green Willow Trees to adapt and
survive in the presence of overwhelming odds. The green willow trees
can be found growing from mountaintops to deserts.

Aoinagi karate is non-contact organization and it promotes the
development of the karate practitioner as a whole. We do practice
Kumite (sparing), but the contact is very minimal and full force is
not used when there is need for contact. And most importantly Aoinagi
aids in the development of body, mind, and spirit. All three are
essential to the practice here in Aoinagi. We not only learn to make
our physical body stronger but we also strive to discipline our mind
and strengthen our spirit.
